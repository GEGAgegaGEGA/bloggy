So. I finished all of my college applications. How do I feel? idk.

I just feel like I've been working really hard while also not. And it always happens like this where I use some big project as an excuse to be lazy. So many in-betweens that I just spent wasting. Evidence: I beat Hollow Knight while supposedly locking in for college apps.

But I know that's how I'm like so I knew this would happen. Although ig acceptance isn't really the ideal outcome so I'll try to be better for the future (I always tell myself).

Regardless, this is a blog you don't need to hear my self dep. I just wanted to put some thoughts on what to do now that college apps are basically done.

First and most urgent, would be olympiads. Idk what I'm doing but USABO is cooked. I didn't have nearly enough time to grind out all the content knowledge so ig the plan now is to cram in 2 weeks by completely ignoring bioinformatics and evolution and that bs(didn't care about that stuff to begin with). Speaking of USABO, I also need to at least hold a mock to make sure I'm doing something for biolympiad which is now kinda dead.

Regardless, USABO is cooked, atp I've switched from actually trying to "I'm just gonna do this for fun"

The stuff I do actually care about is primarily USACO, but also doing well on F=MA would be quite nice(although my plan for that is to just lock tf in on physics after february 4... so like a week to cram and relearn everything... trust...)

<hr>

tldr; olympiads are cooked. So what happens after like... February 21?

At this point, idk. I don't want to waste this free time I'm being gifted but I'm unsure what I want to spend it on. I could spend it prepping for when I'm in college, like seeing if there's classes I can skip or test out of, but that's after I commit so like an after May 1st problem.

So then in the time from March - May is kind of a deadzone for me...

I'll write some ideas that I'll definitely not stick to but it would be cool if I did ->

1. Game jams have been fun and all... but I want to try making a more formal game complete game. I'm lazy to learn an actual game engine though so if I do, I plan to just keep writing it in vanilla JS =D 
2. Math. I'd like to get better at interesting math stuff like learning lin alg, diff eqs, etc. Idk why that's the direction I want to go in, but after USACO idt I'll really be that motivated to keep with CS, maybe physics...? but the math stuff would be cool to have before physics ig... Regardless, I wanna learn the math stuff :)
3. Ngl I feel like any motivation for bio will tank after USABO, but it would be cool to make sure I can not fail my major so I feel I should study bio, or at least the interesting bits
4. Maybe I'll add on later but I honestly don't know... but I know I would regret it if I wasted it

<hr>

In terms of blogging... I agree with zjs that it would be nice to look back on my thoughts over time. I've always liked doing that with what little my past self has left behind, and so I'd like to "expedite"/"formalize" that process a bit...

That's also why this'll prolly act like a more private but censored journal. If someone finds that this site suddenly became active, good for them and it would be my preference for others not to share it.

I'm just... yapping... and like a bit numb and tired... and I didn't know what to do so I decided to start writing this to have some purpose... 

Proofreading is pain and the purpose of blog is to just yap and get ideas down imo. So if it's cringe or bad... whatever... that's not the point so ignore it future me.

Also remind me to get better at file management and organization.
