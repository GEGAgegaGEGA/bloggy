I participated in TriJam #355 on January 17, 2026. 

Right after college apps generally finished to try and just focus on something else. It's a 3 hour jam so it wasn't a big commitment and was kinda fun.

Devlogs are weird for me, so I'll just write down my thinking as it changed and progress reports ->

So every game jam I'm always over ambitious and powercreep/scale the heck out of my ideas so in my imagination it would start with a quick comic panel(I saw a previous trijam winner use one) that would show the backstory along the lines of ->

(Picture of a toothbrush in a cup with cobwebs) "After years of not brushing his teeth..."
(Picture of inside of mouth with holes where teeth once were with acid oozing out as saliva) "A normal salary man's mouth bactera evolved..."
(Silhouette of guy spewing acid from his mouth) "to spew acid from his mouth!"
(Cover image of the game)

Obviously. That didn't happen. But it woulda been funny.

So I started with the art because I couldn't be bothered to run through the spaghetti that was my MicroJam #42 code (yes I was reusing stuff, how else am I supposed to make a game in 3 hours??).

At the ~37 minute mark I had this:

As you can see, I wanted more than one enemy type and also maybe some diversity in the human population and obviously neither happened. But it woulda been cool ->
- Suicide bombers => you *have* to shoot them or else they explode and kill more people than just shooting them
- Shotgun => spread shot to make bullet hell more interesting

Also why did I animate the pools of acid, and the projectiles? idfk

From there, I didn't pay attention cuz I was kinda locked in on the programming. Maybe it was a terrible idea, but I wrote out all the code and then debugged it repeatedly to fix... so I only got a working screen like an hour or so in.
Regardless I remember at around 1:30 I had like our hero on screen getting bumped around by 200 guys.

I remember towards the very end, I tried playing around with the acid spreading, like if one guy died to the breath, they turned into acid. Then, if someone else touched the acid, they too would turn into acid. This was a bad idea as one breath blob would exterminate the entire human race.

At like 10 minutes left on the clock I realized I had no time so to add some sembelence of a "game" I added in a score system and the death screen to give *some* sort of purpose beyond just some random simulation of mechanics(which it still is, and basically all my games are just random sims that aren't fun, but we'll ignore that).

ngl this is all yap but whatever idc.

<hr>

But anyways, I felt kinda good about my game after the time and I decided to check out some other people's. I only looked at 2 but they were actually so good (def giving them good ratings during the rating period).

It's just one level and the general mechanics are simple given it was made in Godot and I've definitely seen something like this before. But I just don't think I would've (and obviously I didn't) think of it in contest and I just feel like I'm not literate/creative enough to do that. My headspace just feels stuck in what I've seen or am conditioned to know (which is like common sense what am I saying) but I wish I could just be able to reach for those ideas that are beyond me out of randomness or smth... idk... I just really like the idea in relation to the prompt and was impressed that the creator was able to come up with it and implement it really well in 3 hours, especially for their second game jam apparently.

[The Exit Interview](https://bucktower.itch.io/the-exit-interview)

Simple game of not moving ur cursor on other coworkers while navigating a maze. The maze level is generally the same and I assume they just copy pasted it a bunch for each floor and added a few walls here and there. The main scaling difficulty factor was just adding more on-screen drunk effects. Again another simple game with simple mechanics but it had such a concrete, simple task and the challenge was reasonable and forgiving. It was fun to just play through the entire thing even if it was the same thing over and over again...

Which I feel is the issue with my game jam games atm -> Level Design

I like making random mechanics but it's not a game until I make actually engaging levels, tasks, things to *do* with those mechanics. Sitting in a room barfing on people isn't that fun until you're told you have to reach the end of the room, or survive x waves without killing anyone, and also instakill while easier to make was probably too unforgiving for people to reasonably try to not kill anyone.

I shouldn't beat myself up over a 3 hour game, but I take issue with the fact that it's been a consistent pattern where I definitely focus a lot more on making interesting mechanics and forfeit all level design. Which... is something I should - *need* - to work on.

So, whenever the next game jam comes around, someone remind me to shut up and try to make interesting levels rather than mechanics. (this is also why I can't make puzzle games for game jams, the creative level design is the most important part, just look at my GMTK 2025 game and see how the mechanic is butchered by awful last-minute levels)

Ok yeah definitely, replaying acid breath man, it would definitely be better if there were a few levels with only like 10 innocents and like you have to get some macguffin while defending against the soldiers...? idk
