*I wanted to log this earlier but not time and I need to write this quick rn cuz no time*
<hr>

Anyways, I went skiing for the first time in a long time with WYT! :D

We tried to plan this trip since last year but no one had the time, especially with college apps. But then even afterwards people weren't that interested... which is sad so only the two most enthusiastic people went: WYT and myself. 

WYT was really cool and got ski rentals for me and his dad also drove both ways so muchos gracias to them.

We started the day with a blue and then WYT wanted to go on a double black diamond right away which was super scary. Looked like a sheer cliff O-o, somehow I got past without falling and we proceeded to do every other double black diamond that was available (which I didn't fall on any of them at first :D)

Then as the day went on my skill went downhill as it tends to do, beginner's luck can be a curse sometimes and I began falling a ton. Idk what else to say tho, it was a lot of fun and I wanted to write it down rq for future posterity :P

also reminder that size 10 ski boots from whatever rental place WYT got them at worked well for me at the time.
